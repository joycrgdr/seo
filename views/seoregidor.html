<h2>1.What is Search Engine Optimization?</h2>

<p> Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a web search engine's unpaid results—often referred to as "natural", "organic", or "earned" results. In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine's users; these visitors can then be converted into customers. SEO may target different kinds of search, including image search, video search, academic search, news search, and industry-specific vertical search engines. SEO differs from local search engine optimization in that the latter is focused on optimizing a business' online presence so that its web pages will be displayed by search engines when a user enters a local search for its products or services. The former instead is more focused on national searches </p>

<h2>2.Guidelines on how to read a Search Engine Result Page </h2>

<p> CHECK OUT THE BIG TWO: ORGANIC AND PAY PER CLICK.
Search results are mostly dominated by two particular indexes: the organic or natural search results, and the PPC (Pay Per Click) search results.

The organic-results index is created by searchbots. For instance, Google uses something called a googlebot to retrieve pages. It’s common to talk about searchbots as if somehow they wander around the Web, moving from page to page through links between the pages, collecting the pages, and sending them back to home base to be analyzed and indexed.

The search results typically put ten results from the organic index into the search-results page, though, those results are often interspersed with other types of search results. (In some cases, in particular when adding local results to the page, the search engines may display a smaller number of organic-search results, perhaps seven or eight.)

Today, the three major search engines all display PPC ads, ads that cost the advertiser nothing until someone clicks the ad, at which point the advertiser is charged instantly.

PPC ads are typically placed at the top of the search results (three or four results, though sometimes Google omits the top ads) and in a column to the right of the main search results. </p>


<h2>3.How SEO Affects Business? </h2>

<p> If you are a business, there are some very real and specific benefits to having a consistent, ongoing search engine optimization strategy. For the first time in the history of marketing, users are offering up their actual intent through the words that they type into search engines. And more than ever before,you can measure the results of your SEO efforts as a marketing channel. While search engines don't charge you for listing your web pages, planning and implementing SEO in your organization is certainly not free. You'll need to spend the time, money, and resources…to do this the right way.

The good news is that this can help you obtain a tremendous marketing reach, attract more targeted visitors, and measure the impact of your efforts in terms of a return on your investment. More and more content appears on the web every second of every day. And your customers need search engines to help make sense of it all. In fact, the bigger the web gets, the more search engine usage continues to grow. People search to find answers to their questions. </p>


<h2>4.List some Important SEO Expectations </h2>

<h3> a. Set realistic goals </h3>
<p> What! What do you mean we aren’t on page one of Google? </p>
<p> Does this question ring any bells? We all know that SEO isn’t simple. A myriad of elements affect position with the search engines, and moving toward those top listings takes time and effort. You understand this, but do your stakeholders? Although SEO is an effective long-term investment, its results are not instantaneous like those of PPC. Setting realistic expectations out of the gate about how search engines work and the types of results you can realistically expect to achieve will do wonders in shaping perception. </p>

<h3> b. Measure the right thing </h3>
<p> Is search engine traffic the best measure of success for your SEO Program? Although increasing the number of visits driven from the engines is a logical goal, should this be the only data point you measure to prove the value of your campaign? </p>

<h3> c. Set a baseline </h3>
<p> One element of measuring success in any SEO campaign is time. Now that you’ve established your Calls to Action and identified all conversion points along the way, setting a baseline to measure progress over time couldn’t be more important.

Remember that search engines need some time to index your newly revamped web pages. Month to month comparisons tend to provide more realistic insight than day to day dips and spikes. Although daily changes can be interesting (and even slightly addictive) to note, be cautious in your reactions. Stay true to your SEO plan to understand the month to month implications of your SEO efforts. Don’t pull the plug on a well-thought SEO plan if you noticed a slight dip yesterday in the SERPs after you changed your heading tags. </p>

<h3> d. Pulling it together </h3>
<p> The longevity of your SEO Campaign is based on a multitude of factors that are typically rolled up into two outcomes – success or failure. Setting realistic goals, measuring your performance towards those goals over time and identifying conversion points all help paint an accurate picture of your SEO campaign.

Setting and managing expectations – your own as well as those of your stakeholders – will work wonders as you move through your SEO Program and prove your value. </p>
